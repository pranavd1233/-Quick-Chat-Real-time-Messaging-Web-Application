Project Title: QuickChat - Real-time Messaging Web Application

Description:

This project is a real-time group chat application designed to facilitate seamless communication among multiple users in a single shared chat room. The application is built using Java Spring Boot on the backend, leveraging WebSocket for real-time bi-directional communication. To ensure compatibility across all browsers, SockJS is integrated as a fallback mechanism for WebSocket.

Key Features:

* Real-time messaging using WebSocket.

* Spring Boot for REST endpoints, WebSocket configuration, and session handling.
* Simple and intuitive Bootstrap UI for ease of use.
* Single group chat room where all connected users can communicate.
* Automatic broadcasting of messages to all subscribed users.

Technologies Used:

* Backend: Java, Spring Boot, WebSocket, SockJS, STOMP
